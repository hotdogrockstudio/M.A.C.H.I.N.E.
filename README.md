### Mass Art Created Harvesting Internet Noise Engine

> "I want to be a machine." — Andy Warhol

This repository is an autonomous production line. It does not sleep. It does not think. It only outputs.

### 🏭 The Assembly Line
Every hour, the engine wakes up to perform a shift:
1. **Harvest:** Scrapes 13 distinct APIs for real-world noise (Crypto, Weather, News, Transit).
2. **Identify:** Scavenges words from the data to name the generation.
3. **Mutilate:** Passes a raw data-canvas through a randomized sequence of industrial filters (Melt, Warp, Stamp, Sort).
4. **Inherit:** Every generation saves a piece of its "DNA" (a Ghost Word and a Legacy Seed) to haunt the next run.

### 📜 Philosophy
- **No Masterpieces:** Just process. Just work.
- **Total Autonomy:** The machine picks its own tools and its own names.
- **Internet Residue:** The art is a direct reflection of the web's current state.
